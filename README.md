This is from Chapter 31 - The TaskCollection and Task classes

Changes in this chapter:

* Implemented TaskCollectionInterface with the TaskCollection class
* Added methods to TaskInterface
* Implement ListInterface with the Task class
* Bound the two interfaces implemented here with the concrete classes
